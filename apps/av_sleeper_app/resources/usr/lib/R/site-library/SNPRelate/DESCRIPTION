Description: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to
    investigate the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they pose many
    computational challenges. We developed an R package SNPRelate to provide
    a binary format for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in GWAS
    utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS) data files. The GDS
    format offers the efficient operations specifically designed for integers
    with two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits. SNPRelate is also
    designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP data using parallel
    computing for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures:
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using
    Identity-By-Descent measures. The SNP format in this package is also
    being used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4 classes and
    generic functions.
