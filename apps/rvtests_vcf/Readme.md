## RVtests (Rare Variant tests) 
<!-- /dx-header -->
Rvtests is a flexible software package for genetic association analysis for sequence datasets.  More information about Rvtests can be found at https://github.com/zhanxw/rvtests.  Version 20170613 of rvtest is included in the app.

## What does this app do?
 It runs a process for each VCF input.  For each VCF file it:
  - splits the VCF into multiple smaller VCF files for analysis
  - runs rvtest on each VCF and phenotype file pair in a parallel job
  - compiles the output into a single file for each of the original VCF files. The output files will be named as the combination of the phenotype file and VCF files.

## What are the input files? 

- **VCF files**: Compressed VCF files required by Rvtests
- **Phenotype files**: Described at https://github.com/zhanxw/rvtests#phenotype-file.  May have more samples than contained in the VCF files.
- **Kinship file**: Optional file generated by vcf2kinship as described in the rvtests documentation at https://github.com/zhanxw/rvtests#kinship-generation.

## What options are always passed to the Rvtests analysis?

'--dosage DS --noweb' are always used in the analysis.  In addition, if a MetaCov.assoc.gz file is generated, the windowSize=500000.
